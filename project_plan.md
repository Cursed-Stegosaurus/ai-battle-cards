# Project Plan: Nate's AI Battle Cards

## Current Platform
- **Platform:** GitHub Pages (static site hosting)
- **SharePoint:** No longer supported or targeted. All SharePoint code and documentation have been removed.

## Major Milestones
- [x] Initial SharePoint prototype (deprecated)
- [x] Migration to GitHub Pages
- [x] Remove SharePoint-specific code and configuration
- [x] Simplify codebase for static hosting

## Current Status
- All code is now static, simple, and designed for GitHub Pages only.
- No SharePoint dependencies remain.

## Next Steps
- Continue UI/UX improvements
- Add new features as needed

## Project Timeline: 1 Week (for initial deployment)

## Phase 1: Planning and Setup (Day 1)

### Day 1: Initial Setup
- [ ] Create a new GitHub repository
- [ ] Set up folder structure (`index.html`, `Cards/`, `scripts/`, `styles/`, JSON data files)
- [ ] Add a README.md with project overview and instructions
- [ ] Commit all files to the repository

## Phase 2: Development and Integration (Days 2-3)

### Day 2: Static Site Preparation
- [ ] Ensure all file paths are relative
- [ ] Update data loading to use static JSON files (no fetch from APIs)
- [ ] Test image and data loading locally (using a local server)
- [ ] Remove SharePoint-specific code and configuration

### Day 3: GitHub Pages Integration
- [ ] Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings (main branch or `/docs` folder)
- [ ] Test site deployment at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/`
- [ ] Fix any path or loading issues
- [ ] Add a custom domain (optional)

## Phase 3: Testing and Documentation (Days 4-5)

### Day 4: Functional Testing
- [ ] Test card grid, flip animation, and preview panel
- [ ] Test model comparison and favorites views
- [ ] Test on multiple browsers (Edge, Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- [ ] Test on mobile and desktop
- [ ] Test all links and images

### Day 5: Documentation
- [ ] Update README.md with deployment and usage instructions
- [ ] Add troubleshooting and FAQ section
- [ ] Document file structure and maintenance steps

## Phase 4: Launch and Maintenance (Days 6-7)

### Day 6: Launch
- [ ] Announce site availability to users/stakeholders
- [ ] Monitor for issues and feedback

### Day 7: Maintenance Planning
- [ ] Set up a regular update schedule (for cards, images, data)
- [ ] Document backup and version control procedures
- [ ] Plan for future enhancements (new features, UI updates)

## Resource Requirements

### Team Members
- Project Owner
- Web Developer
- QA Tester
- Technical Writer

### Tools and Resources
- GitHub account
- Code editor (VS Code, etc.)
- Local web server for testing (Node.js, Python, etc.)
- Modern web browser

## Risk Management

### Identified Risks
1. Path or CORS issues on GitHub Pages
2. Large image files slowing load times
3. Browser compatibility issues
4. Data file format errors
5. Accidental exposure of sensitive data (if repo is public)

### Mitigation Strategies
1. Use only relative paths and static files
2. Optimize images before upload
3. Test on all major browsers
4. Validate JSON data before deployment
5. Review repo contents before making public

## Communication Plan

### Stakeholder Updates
- Progress reports via GitHub Issues or Discussions
- Announcements via email or internal channels
- User feedback via GitHub Issues

### Documentation
- README.md for setup, usage, and troubleshooting
- Inline code comments
- Update logs in the repository

## Success Metrics
- Successful deployment to GitHub Pages
- All features working as intended
- Fast load times and smooth animations
- Positive user feedback
- Easy maintenance and updates
